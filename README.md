# recipe-finder

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).

## Node version

- v20.13.1

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```

### Deploy in gh-pages

```sh
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

üìå Design

üõ† Tools & Libraries Used

I intentionally avoided component libraries to better showcase my coding skills. The technologies and tools used are:

TypeScript: Adds static type checking, helping catch errors early, reducing bugs, and making the code more robust.

Pinia: Applied for state management, ensuring a reactive and centralized state in the browser.

Vue Router: Used to handle navigation between separate views for recipe search and favorite recipes.

ESLint & Prettier: Enforced consistent code style, prevented errors, and improved maintainability.

GitHub Pages (gh-pages): Used for project deployment.

Vitest: Implemented unit testing.

Vite: Chosen as the build tool for faster development and optimized production builds.

‚ôø Accessibility

This project follows WCAG guidelines to ensure accessibility compliance. The complete accessibility report is available in the project‚Äôs docs folder.

üöÄ Future Improvements & Nice-to-Have Features

Due to time constraints, some features were considered but not implemented. These include:

Better error handling throughout the application.

Complete unit testing for all components.

Husky integration to enforce linting and formatting on pre-commits and automate deployments post-push.

Enhanced UI/UX by adding animations and smooth transitions.

Improved accessibility refinements beyond WCAG compliance.

Optimized CSS structure to reduce duplicate code and improve maintainability.

i18n support for multi-language functionality.

This README provides an overview of the project, its design choices, and potential future enhancements. üöÄ
